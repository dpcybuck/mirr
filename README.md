# mirr
Please check out the mzbat repo for updates and changes.  There has been a lot of work there to make this conent easier to consume and use during the MIRR.

This repo is my exension for small things like adding fake job descriptions.  Or, a workspace before I ask [github]mzbat to pull my change in.
